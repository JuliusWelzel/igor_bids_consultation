This page provides information regarding the IGOR BIDS consultation hour. In monthly meetings we will answer questions about individual problems when converting datasets to the BIDS format.
The consultation hour will be held on the 4th Friday of each month at 12:00 am. You will find [Julius](https://juliuswelzel.github.io/welzel.github.io/) to be present to answer your questions about BIDS. His background is in EEG and motion data, but he is happy to help with any other modality.
